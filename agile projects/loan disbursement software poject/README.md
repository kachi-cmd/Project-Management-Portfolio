#### Project Scope:

1. Loan Types:
   - Amortized: Develop a system capable of handling loans with regular payments that include both principal and interest.
   - Simple Interest: Implement functionality for loans with interest calculated only on the initial principal.
   - Bullet Loans: Provide support for loans with a single, large payment at the end of the loan term.

2. Functionality:
   - Disbursement of Various Loan Types: Design workflows for the efficient disbursement of each loan type, ensuring accuracy and compliance with financial regulations.
   - Receipt of Payments: Enable a secure and user-friendly payment gateway, integrating various payment methods for customer convenience.
   - Tracking of Loan Repayment Schedule: Implement a robust tracking system that provides real-time updates on the loan repayment schedule, helping customers stay informed about their financial commitments.

3. API Integration:
   - Connectivity: Develop APIs to establish seamless connectivity between the ERP loan software and the client's portal and mobile app.
   - Documentation: Create comprehensive documentation detailing each API, including dependencies, variables, and environmental variables (ENVs).
   - Security Measures: Implement secure data transfer protocols to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive financial information.

##### Success Criteria:  
The project's success will be measured by achieving 100% customer adoption within 2 months after project completion, signifying the software's effectiveness and user acceptance.

##### Resources:
- Team: Assemble a 9-member cross-functional team comprising software developers, API specialists, UI/UX designers, project managers, and quality assurance professionals.
- Budget: Allocate N2,300,000 to cover development costs, API integration, testing, documentation, and deployment expenses.

##### Timeline: 
The project timeline is set for 1 month, with a prudent extension of two weeks to ensure thorough testing and the mitigation of unforeseen challenges.
